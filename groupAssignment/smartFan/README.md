# Flask web server & control for Arduino

Trying to make this easy

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install:

```bash
pip install flask
pip install flask-wtf
pip install requests
```
you probably have pip already but make sure you are using pip3 if you are on Linux and maybe mac, as that will install python 3 packages

## Usage

```bash
python webApp.py
or
python3 webApp.py
```
Go to [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)
